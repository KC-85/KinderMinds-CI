# Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In the following sections, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough manual testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [anxiety.html](https://github.com/KC-85/KinderMinds-CI/blob/main/anxiety.html) | [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://kc-85.github.io/KinderMinds-CI/anxiety.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html--anxiety.png) | ⚠️ Notes (if applicable) |
|  | [depression.html](https://github.com/KC-85/KinderMinds-CI/blob/main/depression.html) | [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://kc-85.github.io/KinderMinds-CI/depression.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html--depression.png) | ⚠️ Notes (if applicable) |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| assets | [style.css](https://github.com/KC-85/KinderMinds-CI/blob/main/assets/css/style.css) | [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https://kc-85.github.io/KinderMinds-CI) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-assets-style.png) | There are some errors and warnings, however, these are related to Bootstrap & not the plain CSS within style.css. |


## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project to check for responsiveness issues.

## Responsiveness

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is to test the following 3 sizes:

| Page | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet/tablet-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop/desktop-home.png) | Works as expected |
| Anxiety | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile/mobile-anxiety.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet/tablet-anxiety.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop/desktop-anxiety.png) | Works as expected |
| Depression | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile/mobile-depression.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet/tablet-depression.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop/desktop-depression.png) | Works as expected |
| DV Mental Health | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile/mobile-dvmentalhealth.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet/tablet-dvmentalhealth.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop/desktop-dvmentalhealth.png) | Works as expected |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/mobile/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/tablet/tablet-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/desktop/desktop-404.png-404.png) | Works as expected |

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Page | Chrome | Firefox | Brave | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/brave/home.png) | Works as expected |
| Anxiety | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/anxiety.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/anxiety.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/brave/anxiety.png) | Works as expected |
| Depression | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/depression.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/depression.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/brave/depression.png) | Works as expected |
| DV Mental Health | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/dvmentalhealth.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/dvmentalhealth.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/brave/dvmentalhealth.png) | Works as expected |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome/404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox/404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/brave/404.png) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop |

| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-home.png) |
| Anxiety | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-anxiety.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-anxiety.png) |
| Depression | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-depression.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-depression.png) |
| DV Mental Health | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-dvmentalhealth.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-dvmentalhealth.png) |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-404.png) |

## User Story Testing

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Testing User Stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **Features** should already align with the **User Stories**, so this should be as simple as creating a table with the User Story, matching with the re-used screenshot from the respective Feature.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

| Target | Expectation | Outcome | Screenshot | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| As a user | I want links to clear, simple explanations of mental health topics | so I can understand Anxiety, Depression, and DV-related issues without feeling overwhelmed. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/navbar.png) |
| As a user | I want the navigation to be intuitive and accessible | so I can easily move between topics on any device. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/depression.png) |
| As a user | I want the site to feel calm and visually gentle | so I can read sensitive content comfortably. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/hero.png) |
| As a user | I want practical, supportive self-care ideas | so I know what small steps I can take. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/self-care.png) |
| As a user | I would like the website to be fully responsive | so that I can easily navigate and access information from my phone, tablet, or desktop. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/navbar.png) |
| As a user | I would like to see a 404 error page if I get lost | so that it's obvious that I've stumbled upon a page that doesn't exist. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/404.png) |

## Bugs

### Known Issues

| Issue | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| The project is designed to be responsive from `375px` and upwards, in line with the material taught on the course LMS. Minor layout inconsistencies may occur on extra-wide (e.g. 4k/8k monitors), or smart-display devices (e.g. Nest Hub, Smart Watches, Gameboy Color, etc.), as these resolutions are outside the project’s scope, as taught by Code Institute. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/poor-responsiveness.png) |
| When validating HTML with a semantic `<section>` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable. | ![screenshot](documentation/issues/section-header.png) |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
